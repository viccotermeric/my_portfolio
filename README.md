## What is this?

This is my personal portfolio — built as a fully interactive terminal with an AI assistant named **Terminal**. Instead of a static page with a PDF link, you get a shell-like experience where you can run commands, explore projects with live screenshots, ask questions in plain English, switch colour themes, and read my career history formatted as a deployment log.

Not a terminal person? Hit the screen icon in the top-right corner to switch to Standard View — a tab-based layout with the same content.

Type `help` to see what's available. Type `diff` or `patch notes` if you want the release story first.

## Commands worth trying

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `log` | My career as a system log — from Pondicherry to San Jose |
| `projects <slug>` | Deep-dive on a project: pipeline, stack, highlights, screenshots |
| `diff` | What changed between v24 and v25 of me |
| `patch notes` | v25.0.0 release notes — deprecations, additions, known bugs |
| `terminal --version` | Current system profile |
| `availability` | Role types, location, start date |
| `sudo hire` | The short case for hiring me |
| `creator` | The person behind the terminal |
| `sys --alloc` | Live free-list allocator demo — compiled from C to WASM |
| `sys --shell` | Embedded mini shell with pipes and redirection |
| `sys --threads` | Round-robin thread scheduler with deadlock visualisation |
| `theme --list` | Switch between built-in colour themes |
| `man [command]` | Unix-style manual page for any command |

- **Frontend** — React 19 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Styling** — CSS custom properties + Tailwind utility classes (build-time, no CDN)
- **Backend** — Vercel Serverless Functions
- **AI** — Google Gemini with a RAG pipeline
- **Vector DB** — Pinecone
- **Systems demos** — C compiled to WASM via Emscripten (free-list allocator, mini shell, thread scheduler)
- **Analytics** — Vercel Web Analytics

## How Terminal works

When you ask a question in plain English, Terminal doesn't just pass it to a language model and hope for the best:

1. If there's conversation history, the question is rewritten into a standalone form
2. The question is embedded with Gemini
3. Pinecone is queried for the most relevant chunks from my actual portfolio data
4. Those chunks are injected into the prompt as grounding context
5. Gemini generates a response based only on what's in my portfolio

This keeps the answers accurate and specific to my actual background — not a model hallucinating a plausible-sounding resume.

## Terminal UX details

The terminal is designed to feel like a real shell, not a novelty widget:

- `Tab` autocompletes commands with shared-prefix support (like bash)
- `Ctrl+C` cancels an in-flight AI request mid-stream
- `↑` / `↓` navigates command history
- `man [command]` opens a formatted manual page
- `theme [name]` switches the colour theme instantly and persists across visits
- Screen reader support via `aria-live` on the output region

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Google AI API key
- Pinecone API key + a populated index named `portfolio-rag`

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viccotermeric/viccotermeric.github.io.git
cd viccotermeric.github.io
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# add your keys to .env
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` requests to the deployed Vercel backend during local development so you don't need to run `vercel dev` separately.

Prebuilt `.wasm` binaries for the systems demos are committed under `public/wasm/` and work out of the box. If you modify the C sources under `systems/`, rebuild with:

```bash
npm run build:wasm
```

This requires Emscripten (`emcc`) to be installed and on your `PATH`.

### Build, test, and preview

```bash
npm run build      # production build
npm test           # run Vitest unit tests
npm run preview    # local preview of the production build
```
